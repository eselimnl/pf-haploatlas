# Pf-HaploAtlas
The _Plasmodium falciparum_ Haplotype Atlas (or Pf-HaploAtlas) allows anyone with an internet connection to study and track genetic mutations across any gene in the _P. falciparum_ genome! The app provides visualisations of haplotypes for all 5,102 core genes by using data from 16,203 samples, from 33 countries, and spread between the years 1984 and 2018, facilitating comprehensive spatial and temporal analyses of genes and variants of interest. 

Pf-HaploAtlas currently uses data generated using the [MalariaGEN Pf7 whole genome sequencing data release](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-22/v1), but will expand with each new MalariaGEN _Plasmodium_ data release. 

We encourage users to access and share the app using the following stable link to prevent outages in service: https://apps.malariagen.net/pf-haploatlas.

The accompanying preprint manuscript for the Pf-HaploAtlas will be published soon.

# How to run the app locally
This repository contains a Streamlit app. Follow the steps below to clone the repository and run the app locally.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- pip (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:malariagen/pf-haploatlas.git
cd pf-haploatlas
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```
python -m venv .venv
```
Then, activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows: ```.venv\Scripts\activate```
- On macOS/Linux: ```source .venv/bin/activate```

### 3. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the app
```
python -m streamlit run app/main.py
```
The app should naturally open in your browser but if not, click on the ```Network URL``` that appears in the terminal. For further details, please refer to the [Streamlit documentation](https://streamlit.io/).
